            <p>Mallards can be found in almost any wetland habitats, including permanent wetlands such as marshes, bogs, riverine floodplains, beaver ponds, lakes, reservoirs, ponds, city parks, farms, and estuaries. 
                They also occur in prairie potholes and ephemeral wetlands; they may be found feeding along roadside ditches, pastures, croplands and rice fields.
                Mallards are generalist foragers and will eat a wide variety of food. They donâ€™t dive, but dabble to feed, tipping forward in the water to eat seeds and aquatic vegetation. 
                They also roam around on the shore and pick at vegetation and prey on the ground. 
                During the breeding season, they eat mainly animal matter including aquatic insect larvae, earthworms, snails and freshwater shrimp. During migration, many Mallards consume largely agricultural seed and grain. 
                In city parks, they readily accept handouts from parkgoers.
